# What Is Prasasti

Prasasti (Indonesian word for "inscription", pronounced `/pra.sas.ti/`, like `/pra-sas-tee/`) is an offline-first note application.

The idea is, store your notes in `indexedDB` which live inside your browser.

So, the notes or everything you type and insert is never sent to the cloud. No one can see it except you.

You can download all of your notes and media in one single bundled file called "Prasasti"

## SlateJS

I used quill before and I know how pailfull it is to add a custom nodes and custom node is the main idea of this application as we want to add table, lists maybe even charts. So for text editor, I don't think there's a better choice than SlateJS
